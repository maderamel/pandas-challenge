##PyCity Schools Analysis##

Based on the analysis, three key conclusions can be made:
1. Small and Medium sized schools far out-performed large schools.
2. Incresead spending per student did *not* correlate with increased overall passing rates.
3. On average, charter schools far out-performed traditional public schools.

Independent of funding and school type, small and medium schools had significantly higher overall passing rates (averaging 89-90%) than large schools did (avergaging 58%). It should be noted that the only large school with a comparable passing rate to the small/medium schools was also the only charter school in the large category. On average, charter schools out-performed public schools with overall passing rates at 90% compared to 53%. This suggests a need for further analysis on what factors contribute to the success of charter schools over public schools. Conventionally, it has been thought that higher spending per student would yield higher passing rates; however, this analysis suggests the inverse to be true. This further supports the need for a more in depth anlaysis of the differences between charter and public schools.
